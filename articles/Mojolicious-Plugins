I've recently released a couple more <a href="http://mojolicio.us">Mojolicious</a> Plugins:

<ul><li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mojolicious-Plugin-ParamsAuth/">Mojolicious::Plugin::ParamsAuth</a></li><li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mojolicious-Plugin-SslAuth/">Mojolicious::Plugin::SslAuth</a></li></ul>

<p>
They're quite simple, and match the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mojolicious-Plugin-BasicAuth/">Mojolicious::Plugin::BasicAuth</a> implementation.
</p>

<p>
SslAuth uses the recently added TLS certificate authentication support in Mojolicious 1.01.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/773870.js?file=gistfile1.pl"></script>

<p>
The first argument passed to the callback sub is the IO handle, giving you access to whatever  IO::Socket::SSL provides.  (get_cipher, for example).
</p>

<p>
ParamsAuth is very basic, its purpose being to keep your params-based authentication uniform with other auth-types.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/773872.js?file=gistfile1.pl"></script>

<p>
The arguments passed to the callback are the values from the named form or query parameters.
</p>

<p>
BasicAuth has been around for a while, and uses a similar interface:

<p>
If you're looking to be hip with the latest oauth goodness, Marcus Ramberg recently released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mramberg/Mojolicious-Plugin-OAuth2-0.02/lib/Mojolicious/Plugin/OAuth2.pm">Mojolicious::Plugin::OAuth2</a>.
</p>

...

<p>
On a side note, Вячеслав Тихановский (vti) updated <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MojoX-Validator/">MojoX::Validator</a> only days ago.  It is, to date, the only form validation helper that doesn't make me think Amway would have been a better career choice.  It can be integrated into Mojolicious or used separately.  And, like Mojolicious, the code is easy to understand and contribute to.  Join up!
